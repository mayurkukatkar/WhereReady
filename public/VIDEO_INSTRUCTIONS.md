# 404 Errors for Video Files
The console errors you are seeing:
- `GET /video-poster.jpg 404`
- `GET /hero-bg.mp4 404`
Are because these files are not yet in your `public` folder.

**I have generated a placeholder `video-poster.jpg` for you** to fix the first error.

**For `hero-bg.mp4`**:
1.  Please find a background video you like (e.g., from Pexels, Pixabay, or a paid stock site).
2.  Rename the file to `hero-bg.mp4`.
3.  Place it in the `public` folder: `d:\spring projects\WhereReady website\public\hero-bg.mp4`.

Once you do this, the video will automatically appear and the 404 error will vanish.
